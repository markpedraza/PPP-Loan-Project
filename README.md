Analysis of the PPP Loans that were issued to Small Businesses during COVID-19.


The Small Business Administration (SBA) is a U.S. government agency that’s all about helping small businesses and entrepreneurs thrive. Established in 1953, the SBA’s goal is to foster the growth and stability of small businesses, which play a crucial role in the American economy. Through its range of programs, the SBA provides financial support, mentorship, and resources to help small businesses tackle challenges, secure funding, and grow.
When COVID-19 hit, the SBA offered relief to small businesses through programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Offering financial aid to businesses struggling to keep their employees and cover their expenses. The  SBA helped prevent layoffs and closures, giving a much-needed boost to local communities across the country at a time when it was needed most.

## BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:

The main business requirement for your project is to analyze if the ratio between the total amount of PPP loans issued per county and the county's GDP makes sense. This involved examining how well the load distribution aligns with the GDP of each county, which will then provide insight into whether the loans were distributed in proportion to each counties capacity, population, and economic needs.
Functional Requirements:

**Total Loan by Companies:** To understand the allocation of loans on an individual company level.

**Total Loan by State and by County:** To understand how loans were distributed geographically

**Total Business by States:** To see the quantity of business receiving support by state

**Top 10 Lenders by State**: To identify major PPP loan lenders and assess their impact.

**Total Loan by Lenders**: To evaluate the role of different lenders in the PPP distribution.

**Classification by NAICS Code (Version 2022):** To analyze loan distribution by industry and sector.

**Aggregate Data Based on GDP (Pre- and Post-COVID):** to evaluate economic impact and loan distribution pre and post covid


## DATA REQUIREMENTS: 

**NAICS Codes:**
Link: https://www.census.gov/naics/ 
Description: Data will be used to classify businesses that received PPP loans. 

**GDP Data by County:**
Link: https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp
Description: This data will be used to evaluate the GDP vs the PPP loan received by each county

**PPP Loan Data**
Link: https://data.sba.gov/dataset/ppp-foia
Description: This data set will be used to analyze loan distribution by company, county, state, and industry. 

## PROJECT RISKS:

**Data Accuracy and Completeness:**  The PPP loan and GDP data may have inaccuracies or missing data. Which could affect the reliability of the analysis.

Prevention: Clean the data using techniques to improve the quality of the analysis. 

**Data Combination:** Combining data from multiple sources (PPP loans, GDP, and NAICS codes) may be complex and could lead to errors in data processing and disorganization. This could lead to delays in the project.

Prevention: Staying organized as a group when dealing with multiple sets of data. Communication will be key.


## PROJECT COSTS: 

**Time investment:** The project reports significant time for data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization. Team members will need to allocate time to work on each phase, which could impact other commitments 

**Software and Tools:**  Using data analysis and visualization tools may have associated costs. Potential costs if premium software features are needed or additional data storage are required. To prevent this, we will attempt to fully utilize free or student version of software or tools.

## PROJECT BENEFITS:

**Insightful Analysis of Loan Distribution:** Upon completion of our project, our team will have an understanding of how well the PPP loads were allocated based on economic needs and will be able to identify patterns or gaps in distributions. 

**Understanding of industry needs:** Understanding loans by industry will highlight which sectors were most reliant on government support versus what was thriving more during the Covid-19 period. 

## COMPANY PERSONA:

**Policymakers and Government Agencies:** The analysis of PPP loans will provide clear insights into their effectiveness, helping to design better-targeted financial aid programs for future national crises like COVID-19.

**Businesses and Industry leaders:** Businesses who view our project analysis can understand the load distribution trends which can help businesses advocate for support or adjust strategies to better withstand economic issues.
